# Rory
Rory is a Open Source Discord Bot written in JavaScript. I also decided to connect it directly to the ShinoaFileNetwork, a Express.JS Server for File Downloads.

# Shinoa File Network (Work in Progress)
The Shinoa File Network is currently a Stand Alone Script.
I will try to add it to the Bot soon.

# Setup
```shell
npm i
node rory
```
